My personal sorting implementations in Python :

* Selection Sort
* Gnome Sort
* Bubble Sort 
* Shell Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Comb Sort
* Cocktail Sort ( or Bidirectional Sort )
* Oleyami Sort ( reviewed Cocktail Sort )
* Counting Sort
* Radix Sort
* Heap Sort (using heapq library )
* Heap Sort ( personal implementation )

# Recursive Algorithms

" Can you always turn a recursive function into an iterative one? Yes, absolutely, and the Church-Turing thesis proves it if memory serves. In lay terms, it states that what is computable by recursive functions is computable by an iterative model (such as the Turing machine) and vice versa. The thesis does not tell you precisely how to do the conversion, but it does say that it's definitely possible. ". Found on StackOverflow
